How to start:
Run npm install to install all the dependencies and then run npm start to run the app

Technical Choices:
Tailwind css: I have used tailwind css because it is easy to create UIs with predefined shades and also no need to worry about class names being same at different files and it used the prettier plugin to auto align classes so the code is easily workable on by other programmers.

I went with the most basic design for the website and left lot of room for improvement because of the time constraint
